# Face-Mask Recognition Project 
This project utilizes a Kaggle dataset to build a face mask detection application using Streamlit, which classifies images into three categories:

   - Correct (Mask)
   - Incorrect (Mask)
   -  No Mask
Technologies Used:

 Kaggle Dataset: For training data on face masks.
s
 TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the deep learning model.

 OpenCV: For image processing and webcam integration.

Streamlit: For creating the web application interface.

The application employs deep learning models for real-time face mask detection via a webcam, providing a user-friendly interface. To set up the project:

Clone the repository.
Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the app with streamlit run app.py.
